## Desciption

This was a quick and simple project for use at the [North American Championship 2022](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/competitions/NAC2022#competition-schedule) Rubik's Cube competition. It was projected on the screen in the main room. It displays the current and next groups for each stage.

Later, I made some modifications to make it suitable for local competitions (which typically don't have stages).

## Creation

This was essentially stolen and modified, with permission, from [Tim Reynolds](https://github.com/timreyn/usnationals/tree/master/src/static).

## Flaws and Features

This was put together in a rush and could have been structured better. Visually, it's not the nicest thing to look at.

The current page is stored in local storage, so persists when closing and re-opening the tab/browser.
